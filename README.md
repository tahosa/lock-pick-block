Lock Pick Block
===============

This is a suite of files that define a knife-block-like tool holder for lock
picking tools like picks, rakes, tension wrenches, plug followers, allen keys,
and whatever else you can fit. It is designed to be generic, accounting for some
of the largest-dimensioned tools available, so it should work for whatever tools
you have.

### File Formats

Files are provided in `.f3d` for modification in Autodesk Fusion 360, and `.stl`
